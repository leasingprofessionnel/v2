The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the CRM from a basic MVP to a feature-rich application. The initial phase focused on restoring functionalities lost during a simplified Replit deployment attempt, including PDF export, reminder management, and comprehensive vehicle/commercial lists. Subsequently, the engineer implemented several key user requests: advanced lead sorting by various criteria, a robust automatic and manual data backup/restore system, and the ability to delete reminders. Further enhancements included conditional display of commission and contract date fields based on lead status, making vehicle selection optional during lead creation, and a refined status system with color-coding (À CONTACTER in red, LIVRÉE in green, others orange). The integration of the BYD car brand with its models, and automated contract end date calculation, further enriched the system. A Clients page was introduced to separate delivered leads, improving pipeline clarity. The current ongoing task is to make the CRM fully responsive across devices, ensuring all functionalities are available on mobile, not just a view-only mode.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a modern, responsive web CRM for long-term vehicle leasing lead and commercial opportunity management. Core needs included lead creation/modification (company, contact, vehicle details, status pipeline), organization/reminders (calendar, notifications), and advanced features like search/filtering and data export (CSV, XML, then PDF). The design required a professional French theme. Subsequent enhancements expanded the commercial/prestataire lists, added multi-vehicle selection (1-20), a multi-line Note field, reminder creation/integration, Tarif mensuel and Commission agence fields, a Paiement dropdown (En attente, Payé), Date de livraison (active only when status is accord), and auto-calculated Date de fin de contrat. Dashboard statistics for Commissions Payées and Commissions En Attente were also added. The CRM was rebranded CRM LEASINPROFESSIONNEL.FR. Recent requests included robust sorting, persistent data backup/restore, reminder deletion, conditional display of commission fields (only for accord or livrée status), optional vehicle details during lead creation, a new À CONTACTER status (red), LIVRÉE status (green), other statuses (orange), a fix for the Modifier button, adding BYD brand/models, auto-calculated Date fin de contrat based on Date de livraison and contract duration (only if status is livrée), and a modifiable Date de création du lead with sorting capabilities. The current overarching requirement is full mobile/responsive functionality.

- Complete the responsive design for the CRM, specifically optimizing the lead creation/modification form for mobile use to ensure full functionality mirroring the desktop version.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively working on improving the CRM's responsive design to ensure that the mobile/responsive version has the same full capabilities as the desktop version, rather than being limited to consultation. This effort began by addressing navigation limitations on mobile by modifying the  component in  to include a mobile hamburger menu. Following this, the engineer started adapting the display of tables () to a more mobile-friendly card format. The very last action stated was the continuation of this responsive work, specifically focusing on making the lead creation/modification form () completely responsive and optimized for mobile devices. The backend is fully functional with all previously requested features, and the primary outstanding task is the completion and verification of the frontend's responsive adaptation for all user interactions.
